# PowerSave-TCP-Add-on

A containerized TCP proxy service for Home Assistant that detects incoming connections on specified ports (e.g., Minecraft, Emby, OtherService), triggers Wake-on-LAN to power on a remote worker machine, waits for it to become available, and seamlessly forwards traffic. This add-on is specifically designed for Home Assistant (HASSIO) environments, providing an efficient way to manage power consumption by keeping high-energy servers off until required.
